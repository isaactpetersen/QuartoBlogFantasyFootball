# Welcome to my Blog! {#sec-welcome}

Welcome to my blog entitled, "INSERT TITLE HERE".
This is my first blog post.

# Instructions {#sec-instructions}

In this assignment, you will be creating your "Welcome to my Blog" post by editing the contents of this document.
Please follow the instructions below:

- In the header (above), change the author name to your full name and change the date.
- Change the post image (you'll need to add the image to the folder and update the file name above).
- Insert headers for the following sections (I aleady created a header for the first section for you):
    - "About Me"
    - "About This Blog"
- Add the info described below to the relevant section:
    - Insert a blog title.
    - Introduce yourself and tell the readers about yourself (nothing you don't feel comfortable sharing).
    - Say what your blog articles will be about (generally) and why you are excited to write about that.
    - Say something about the unique perspective you will bring to writing about that topic.
- Remove this "Instructions" section (and the notes below) when you post your article.

Notes:

- This is a **public** blog.
The whole world can see it.
This can increase the visibility of your work and profile.
You can expect that anything you write online is **permanent**.
My strong suggestion is: <u>Don't write anything that you wouldn't feel comfortable with your parents or (current or) future employer seeing.</u>
- The writing should be your own!
- For all graphics, you should either a) create them yourself or b) use only those graphics that you have the license to use.
You can use graphics with a Creative Commons license as long as you follow the terms of the license (e.g., cite the original, indicate if you make any changes, etc).
To find graphics that have a Creative Commons license, when using Google Image Search, select: "Tools" > "Usage Rights" > "Creative Commons Licenses".
