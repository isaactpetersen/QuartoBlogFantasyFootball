Welcome to my blog entitled, "INSERT TITLE HERE".
This is my first blog post.

# Instructions {#sec-instructions}

In this assignment, you will be creating your "Welcome to my Blog" post by editing the contents of this document.
Please follow the instructions below:

- In the header (above), change the author name to your full name and change the date.
- Feel free to change the post image if you'd like (you'll need to add the image to the folder and update the file name above).
- Insert a blog title.
- Introduce yourself and tell the readers about yourself (nothing you don't feel comfortable sharing).
- Say what your blog articles will be about (generally) and why you are excited to write about that.
- Say something about the unique perspective you will bring to writing about that topic.
- Remove the "Instructions" section when you post your article.

Notes:

- This is a **public** blog.
The whole world can see it.
This can increase the visibility of your work and profile.
You can expect that anything you write online is **permanent**.
My strong suggestion is: <u>Don't write anything that you wouldn't feel comfortable with your parents or (current or) future employer seeing.</u>
