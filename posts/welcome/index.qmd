Welcome to my blog entitled, "INSERT TITLE HERE".
This is my first blog post.

# Instructions {#sec-instructions}

- Insert a blog title (above)
- Feel free to change the post image if you'd like (you'll need to add the image to the folder and update the file name above)
- Introduce yourself (first name or full name) and tell the readers about you are (nothing you don't feel comfortable sharing).
- Say what your blog articles will be about (generally) and why you are excited to write about that.
- Say something about the unique perspective you will bring to writing about that topic.
