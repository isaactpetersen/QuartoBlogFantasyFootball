# Intro {#sec-intro}

This document provides instructions for your blog posts.
This document is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) document, which is an example of a computational notebook.
[Quarto](https://quarto.org) enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.
In a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) document, the results appear beneath the code.
This allows you to share your data, statistical code, results, graphics, and text interpreting the analyses all in-line.
Sharing data and your analysis code with others helps ensure reproducibility—i.e., that others get the exact same results as you.
For more information on the value of computational notebooks, see the article titled "[The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/)".

# Instructions for Working with Quarto {#sec-quartoInstructions}

- **Use a new line for every sentence.** 
This helps with version control—individually changed sentences will be highlighted upon commits (which are easy to parse to identify the specific changes) rather than whole paragraphs (which are a nightmare to parse to identify the specific changes).
- Add linked content (e.g., images) to the sub-directories of the relevant post
- Use no spaces in file or folder names.
Use a dash (-) instead of a space.
- When making numbered (ordered) lists, just use `1. ` for all numbers.
[Quarto](https://quarto.org) will make them sequential automatically.
- To update the list of `R` packages that are installed for running the blog post (`.qmd`) files, update the `DESCRIPTION` file.

# Level-1 Heading {#sec-level1Heading}

This is a post with executable code.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Level-2 Heading {#sec-level2Heading}

### Level-3 Heading {#sec-level3Heading}

#### Level-4 Heading {#sec-level4Heading}

# Adding Code Options {#sec-addCodeOptions}

You can add options to executable code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false

2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
Below is a code chunk that specifies `eval: false`, which allows providing code without executing the code:

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("DevPsyLab/petersenlab")
```

Below is a code chunk that specifies `message: false` and `warning: false` to suppress messages and warnings:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library("petersenlab") #located here: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/petersenlab
```

# Plot {#sec-plot}

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

# Image {#sec-image}

# Unordered Lists {#sec-unorderedLists}

- one item
- one item
- one item
    - one more item
    - one more item
    - one more item

# Ordered Lists {#sec-orderedLists}

1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
    - one unordered item
    - one unordered item

# Session Info {#sec-sessionInfo}

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
