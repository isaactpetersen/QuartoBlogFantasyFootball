    "text": "1 Welcome to my Blog!\nWelcome to my blog entitled, “INSERT TITLE HERE”. This is my first blog post.\n\n\n2 Instructions\nIn this assignment, you will be creating your “Welcome to my Blog” post by editing the contents of this document. This document is written in Quarto. Here are the course’s Quarto instructions. However, for this post, you will not need to create a new folder/post from a template (which you will do for future posts)—in this assignment, you will merely edit and re-post this current post.\nTo follow the instructions (below), you must first create a new GitHub repository using the “QuartoBlogFantasyFootball” repository as a template (per the instructions here). Then, you will edit the index.qmd file associated with this post in the following location: ./posts/welcome/index.qmd. Edit the index.qmd file according to the instructions below:\n\nIn the header (above; currently author: \"Insert D. Name\"), change the author name to your full name and change the date (currently date: \"9/2/2025\").\nChange the post image. To do this, you’ll need to add the image file to the same folder as this document and update the file name above (currently image: \"thumbnail.jpg\").\nInsert headers for the following sections (I aleady created a header for the first section for you):\n\n“Welcome to my Blog!”\n“About Me”\n“About This Blog”\n\nAdd the info described below to the relevant section:\n\nInsert a blog title.\nIntroduce yourself and tell the readers about yourself (nothing you don’t feel comfortable sharing).\nSay what your blog articles will be about (generally) and why you are excited to write about that.\nSay something about the unique perspective you will bring to writing about that topic.\n\nRemove this “Instructions” section (and the notes below) when you post your article.\nTo post your article, follow the course’s Quarto instructions to first render it locally, and, if everything looks the way you want it to, push it to GitHub so the article goes live (assuming it renders successfully in GitHub Actions)!\nIf you have difficulty, consult the course’s Quarto instructions.\nWhen submitting, make sure to follow the assignment instructions and the rubric, and to submit both (1) the URL to the live post and (2) a PDF of the post.\nThis is a public blog. The whole world can see it. This can increase the visibility of your work and profile. You can expect that anything you write online is permanent. My strong suggestion is: Don’t write anything that you wouldn’t feel comfortable with your parents or (current or) future employer seeing.\nThe writing should be your own!\nFor all graphics, you should either a) create them yourself or b) use only those graphics that you have the license to use. You can use graphics with a Creative Commons license as long as you follow the terms of the license (e.g., cite the original, indicate if you make any changes, etc). To find graphics that have a Creative Commons license, when using Google Image Search, select: “Tools” &gt; “Usage Rights” &gt; “Creative Commons Licenses”."

    "section": "4.1 The Present Study",
    "text": "4.1 The Present Study\nIn the present study, I examined whether previous performance or previous opportunity is a stronger predictor of future performance among wide receivers. For the predictors, I operationalized a wide receiver’s performance using their receiving yards, obtained from the nflreadr package (Ho & Carl, 2024). I operationalized a wide receiver’s opportunity using their air yards, obtained from the nflreadr package (Ho & Carl, 2024). For the criterion, I examined wide receivers’ fantasy points in the subsequent game, calculated by Petersen (2025) using the ffanalytics package (Andersen, Petersen, & Tungate, 2025). Thus, I examined the wide receiver’s fantasy points and air yards in a given week in predicting their fantasy points in the subsequent week. Although fantasy points are the ultimate outcome, I examined air yards (opportunity) and receiving yards (performance) as a predictor to isolate the predictive utility of yardage-related receiving opportunity relative to yardage-related receiving production. To my knowledge, this is the first study to examine whether previous performance or opportunity is a stronger predictor of future fantasy performance.\nI hypothesized that, due to natural variability from week-to-week that, in part, reflects randomness and is consistent with the statistical principle of regression to the mean, opportunity would be a stronger influence of subsequent performance than previous performance. If the hypothesis is true, I predict that air yards will be a stronger predictor, compared to actual receiving yards, in predicting future fantasy points. Testing this possibility is important for determining what factors may be used to best identify players who, despite not gaining many receiving yards in a given week, may do well in future weeks."

    "section": "5.1 Data",
    "text": "5.1 Data\nBelow, I load the data file used for this post. The data file includes weekly player statistics, including air yards, receiving yards, and fantasy points. I obtained the data file from the Open Science Framework repository for the textbook, “Fantasy Football Analytics: Statistics, Prediction, and Empiricism Using R” (Petersen, 2025).\n\n\nCode\nload(file = \"../../data/player_stats_weekly.RData\")\n\n\nFirst, I subset the data to Wide Receivers:\n\n\nCode\nanalysisData &lt;- player_stats_weekly %&gt;% \n  filter(position_group == \"WR\")\n\n\nThe weekly data include all seasons since 1999 (i.e., currently 1999–2024):\n\n\nCode\nanalysisData %&gt;% \n  arrange(season) %&gt;% \n  select(season) %&gt;% \n  pull() %&gt;% \n  unique()\n\n\n [1] 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\n[16] 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\n\n\nSecond, to prepare the data for analysis, I created a lagged variable for fantasy points so that fantasy points in a subsequent year (e.g., 2024) are in the same row as player performance from the prior year (e.g., 2023). Creation of a lagged variable allowed using previous performance to predict future fantasy points.\nThe original data set includes only those rows for weeks in which a given player played. For instance, if a player played weeks 9 and 11 but missed week 10 due to injury, they would have rows for only week 9 and 11. However, this is a problem if we were to lag a variable (fantasy points) up a row because, in this instance, it would be lagging the variable two weeks (from week 11 to week 9), rather than one week. To ensure that the lagged variable lags only 1 week (and not more weeks), I added missing rows for the missing weeks for given player-season combinations, to ensure each player-season combination had all 18 weeks represented.\n\n\nCode\nanalysisData &lt;- analysisData %&gt;%\n  group_by(player_id, season) %&gt;%\n  tidyr::complete(week = 1:18) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\nThen, I created the lagged variable for fantasy points. I lagged fantasy points within season, so week 1 data did not get lagged to the final week of the prior season.\n\n\nCode\nanalysisData &lt;- analysisData %&gt;% \n  arrange(player_id, season, week) %&gt;% \n  group_by(player_id, season) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    fantasyPoints_lag = lead(fantasyPoints)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\n\n\nBelow, I verify that the lagging worked as expected:\n\n\nCode\nanalysisData %&gt;% \n  select(player_id, player_display_name, season, week, fantasyPoints, fantasyPoints_lag)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nHere are descriptive statistics for the variables that are the focus of this article:\n\n\nCode\nmodelVars &lt;- c(\"receiving_air_yards\",\"receiving_yards\",\"fantasyPoints\",\"fantasyPoints_lag\")\n\nanalysisData %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(all_of(modelVars)) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::summarise(across(\n      everything(),\n      .fns = list(\n        n = ~ length(na.omit(.)),\n        missingness = ~ mean(is.na(.)) * 100,\n        M = ~ mean(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        SD = ~ sd(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        min = ~ min(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        max = ~ max(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        q10 = ~ quantile(., .10, na.rm = TRUE), # 10th quantile\n        q90 = ~ quantile(., .90, na.rm = TRUE), # 90th quantile\n        range = ~ max(., na.rm = TRUE) - min(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        IQR = ~ IQR(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        MAD = ~ mad(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        CV = ~ sd(., na.rm = TRUE) / mean(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        median = ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        pseudomedian = ~ DescTools::HodgesLehmann(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        mode = ~ petersenlab::Mode(., multipleModes = \"mean\"),\n        skewness = ~ psych::skew(., na.rm = TRUE),\n        kurtosis = ~ psych::kurtosi(., na.rm = TRUE)),\n      .names = \"{.col}.{.fn}\")) %&gt;%\n    tidyr::pivot_longer(\n      cols = everything(),\n      names_to = c(\"variable\",\"index\"),\n      names_sep = \"\\\\.\") %&gt;% \n    tidyr::pivot_wider(\n      names_from = index,\n      values_from = value)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe lagged variable of fantasy points has fewer observations than the original fantasy points variable because, as mentioned earlier, I lagged data within seasons; consequently, week 1 data were not lagged to the prior season and thus were not retained in the lagged variable.\nHere is a correlation matrix of the relevant variables:\n\n\nCode\npetersenlab::cor.table(analysisData[,modelVars])"

The associations of air yards and receiving yards with fantasy points were mostly linear, as depicted in Figures 2 and 3.\nTo evaluate the assumption of homoscedasticity, we examined residual and spread-level plots.\nResidual plots is in Figure 5.\n\n\nCode\ncar::residualPlots(\n  regressionModel,\n  id = TRUE)\n\n\n                    Test stat Pr(&gt;|Test stat|)    \nreceiving_air_yards   -14.982        &lt; 2.2e-16 ***\nreceiving_yards       -32.962        &lt; 2.2e-16 ***\nTukey test            -35.378        &lt; 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Residual Plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spread-level plot is in Figure 6.\n\n\nCode\ncar::spreadLevelPlot(\n  regressionModel,\n  id = TRUE)\n\n\n\nSuggested power transformation:  0.5426738 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Spread-Level Plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals appeared to increase as a function of the fitted values.

    "text": "7.1 Strengths and Limitations\nThe study had several strengths. First, I examined data from all seasons since 1999, thus providing strong statistical power to detect differences in the strength of associations. Second, I conducted several sensitivity analyses, providing additional rigor in the methods and additional confidence in the findings.\nThe study also had limitations. First, air yards and other statistical indexes depend on many factors such as the game script and, in a given game, may not be representative of a player’s role in the offense. Second, a player’s inclusion of a given week in the analysis required the player to play in the given game and the following week. Player availability could depend, in part, due to usage; for instance, receivers who run more routes, receive more targets, and obtain more air/receiving yards could be more likely to miss a subsequent game due to injury and thus could be missing systematically from my analysis. This possibility would be important for future work to consider."

    "text": "7.2 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, previous performance is a stronger predictor than previous opportunity in predicting future fantasy performance among wide receivers. However, both previous performance and opportunity are important predictors of fantasy performance and should be considered when predicting wide receiver fantasy performance. Among underperforming players, air yards—as an index of opportunity—may be a useful way of identifying those who may bounce back in subsequent weeks."
